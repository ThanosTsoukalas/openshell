# Openshell
Openshell is a custom shell interface/command line that I created as a hobby project in order to learn C++. It is extremely basic at the moment, but I am looking forward to adding more features to it in the future.

## Linux Support
I am a Windows user, but this project was made with cross-platform in mind. Pretty soon I am going to add Linux support. (In fact, Linux might actually be able to run this project without any modifications; however I am not sure if any instabilities are going to occur in the runtime).

## CMake
If you are working on Visual Studio for this project, as I am, then you should have no problem compiling from source.
