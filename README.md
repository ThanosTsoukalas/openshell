# Openshell
Openshell is a custom shell interface/command line that I created as a hobby project in order to learn C++. It is axtremely basic at the moment, but I am looking forward to adding more features to it in the future.

## CMake
If you are working on Visual Studio for this project, as I am, then you should have no problem in compiling from source.
